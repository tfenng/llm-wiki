# ─── redaction + truncation ────────────────────────────────────────────────

# #416 + #484: default token shapes redacted out of every session
# transcript regardless of user config. CLAUDE.md security model
# promises redaction "before anything hits disk" — these patterns
# close the gap left by relying on user-provided `extra_patterns`.
#
# Original (#416):
# - GitHub PATs: `ghp_*` (classic), `gho_*` (OAuth), `ghs_*`
#   (server-to-server), `ghu_*` (user-to-server), `github_pat_*`
#   (fine-grained)
# - AWS access key IDs: `AKIA*` (20 chars total)
# - Slack tokens: `xoxb-*`, `xoxp-*`, `xoxa-*`, `xoxr-*`, `xoxs-*`
#
# Extended (#484) — added the patterns Pratiyush's developers most
# commonly paste into Claude sessions ("here's my .env, why isn't
# auth working?"). Anything below this comment is one PEM-encoded
# / one prefix-shaped paste away from being committed to raw/ and
# served at the public GitHub Pages URL by the pages.yml workflow:
#
# - Anthropic API keys: `sk-ant-api03-*` (and any future variant)
# - OpenAI keys: classic `sk-*`, project keys `sk-proj-*`,
#   service-account keys `sk-svcacct-*`
# - Google API keys: `AIza[A-Za-z0-9_-]{35}`
# - Stripe live keys: `sk_live_*`, `pk_live_*` (publishable too —
#   leak associates the project with you even if revoked)
# - npm tokens: `npm_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}`
# - JWT structure: `eyJ...eyJ...sig` (loose 3-segment shape)
# - PEM private keys: full BEGIN/END envelope
#
# These run AFTER user `extra_patterns` so users can override.
