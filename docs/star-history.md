# Star History Tracking

Track GitHub star growth over time to understand adoption velocity and
the impact of launches, blog posts, and awesome-list submissions.

## star-history.com chart

Embed a live chart on any page:

**Interactive link:**

```
https://star-history.com/#Pratiyush/llm-wiki&Date
```

**Embeddable image (for blog posts):**

```markdown
[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=Pratiyush/llm-wiki&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#Pratiyush/llm-wiki&Date)
```

**For the README:**

```markdown
## Star History

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=Pratiyush/llm-wiki&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#Pratiyush/llm-wiki&Date)
```

Add this section to the README once the repo has 50+ stars (before that
the chart is too sparse to be meaningful).

## README badge

Add a live star-count badge to the badge row:

```markdown
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Pratiyush/llm-wiki?style=flat&color=7C3AED)](https://github.com/Pratiyush/llm-wiki/stargazers)
```

This uses shields.io and updates automatically. The `color=7C3AED`
matches the llmwiki accent purple.

## Comparing with related projects

star-history.com supports multi-repo charts. Useful for competitive
positioning:
