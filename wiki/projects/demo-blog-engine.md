# demo-blog-engine

Reference project for the Rust SSG track. Source under `content/*.md`,
output under `public/`. Good example of how llmwiki's session logs
capture a realistic build-from-scratch trajectory: scaffolding the
crate, picking the markdown library, adding syntax highlighting, then
the final polish passes (RSS + dark mode).
