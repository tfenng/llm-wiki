"""Automated WCAG 2.1 AA scan via axe-core.

The existing ``test_accessibility.py`` covers a handful of structural
checks (skip-link, aria-labels, focus order). It misses the long
tail: color contrast on every paragraph, heading-level hierarchy,
link names that read as "click here", form-control labels, etc.

This module injects axe-core into each page type, runs the full
scan, and asserts that no ``critical`` or ``serious`` violations
exist. ``moderate`` and ``minor`` are reported but don't fail the
test — they're advisory until we have a clean baseline.

Why we vendor / load axe-core via add_script_tag instead of using
the ``axe-playwright-python`` PyPI package: the package adds an
extra dependency for what is, in essence, two lines of code. We
fetch axe-core from a CDN URL pinned by the version number — a
network failure during CI just skips the test rather than failing
it (a network blip is not an a11y regression).

The CDN URL is from cdnjs.cloudflare.com; the version is pinned so
a release with a behavior change can't break our suite without an
explicit bump.
